## 2024-05-23 - Unique Labels in Lists
**Learning:** Screen readers announce controls by their accessible name. In lists of identical items (like class cards), generic labels like "Delete" or "Hours" become ambiguous ("Delete what?").
**Action:** Always append a unique identifier (like index or ID) to `aria-label` for controls in list items (e.g., "Delete Class 1").
